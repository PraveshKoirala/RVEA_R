# RVEA in R (Work in Progress)

This is a port of the RVEA (reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm) for many-objective optimization in R. The original algorithm is in MATLAB and can be found at [https://github.com/ranchengcn/RVEA_Matlab](https://github.com/ranchengcn/RVEA_Matlab)


Start with the Main.R file.. it contains an example.
